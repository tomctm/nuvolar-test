## Summary

This document provides a comprehensive strategy for the development and deployment of an HTTP API application with Java microservices, Docker, RabbitMQ, and MySQL Cluster. Technology selection, methodology, CI/CD, security, and monitoring are critical considerations to ensure the application's success, especially given the expected high concurrency.

The proposed strategy aims to achieve efficient development and robust implementation, with a focus on scalability, quality, and security. The selection of specific tools and approaches may vary based on the development team's needs and preferences.


I have tried to summarize in different points and steps the development of the implementation of this tool:


1. **Introduction**
   - Application overview.
   - Objectives of the document.
   
2. **Technology Selection**
   - Justification for choosing Java as the programming language.
   - Use of Docker for microservices containerization.
   - Implementation of RabbitMQ for inter-microservice messaging.
   - Implementation of MySQL Cluster for data management.

3. **Development Methodology**
   - Description of the development methodology, e.g., Scrum, Kanban, etc.
   - Specific considerations for microservices development.

4. **Version Control Strategy**
   - Use of Git and GitHub/GitLab/Bitbucket for version control.
   - Development, testing, and production branch strategy.

5. **CI/CD Automation**
   - Description of Continuous Integration (CI) and Continuous Deployment (CD) strategy.
   - Tool selection, e.g., Jenkins, GitLab CI/CD, Travis CI, CircleCI, etc.
   - Configuration of CI/CD pipelines for automated testing and deployment.

6. **Dependency Management**
   - Use of dependency management systems like Maven or Gradle for managing microservice dependencies.

7. **Automated Testing**
   - Implementation of unit, integration, and acceptance tests.
   - Code coverage and quality metrics.

8. **Security**
   - Security strategies, including authentication, authorization, and protection against known vulnerabilities.

9. **Scalability**
   - Strategy for scaling microservices to handle the expected high concurrency.

10. **Error Handling and Monitoring**
    - Tools and approaches for error management and event logging.
    - Health monitoring of the application and microservices.

11. **Conclusion**
    - Summary of key decisions and the development and deployment strategy.

12. **References**
    - Any documentation, tutorials, or resources used in the process.


### CI/CD flow for the deployment of the different tools in Kubernetes.

- Using gitops flow, this would be an example of how to flow could be created:
